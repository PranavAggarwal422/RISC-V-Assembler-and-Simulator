# RISC-V-Assembler-and-Simulator
Designed and implemented a custom assembler and simulator for a subset of the RV32I (RISC-V) instruction set
Converted RISC-V assembly instructions into binary machine code and simulated execution cycle-by-cycle
Handled R, I, S, B, and J instruction formats with label resolution and virtual halt support
Ensured error handling for syntax and instruction-specific issues during assembly
